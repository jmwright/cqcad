## Using CQCad as a Hybrid CAD System
The first focus of CQCad development is the scripting environment, providing a Python editor with the standard features (line numbers, code highlighting, code completion, etc). Unfortunately, the traditional, point-and-click functionality of CQCad will not keep pace at the beginning. However, multiple extensions are planned for this application that will extend the traditional CAD capabilities of CQCad. Some of those extensions are Sketching, Parts, and Assemblies. Once both the scripting and traditional functionality of CQCad are at a sufficient level, this documentation will be filled out with workflows and instructions to help users leverage the combined power of both scripting and mouse-based CAD. You can let us know what functionality is most important to you by opening an [issue](https://github.com/jmwright/cqcad/issues) or starting a thread on the [CadQuery Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cadquery).
