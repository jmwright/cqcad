## Using CQCad as a Pure Model Scripting Environment
The first focus of CQCad development is the scripting environment, providing a Python editor with the standard features (line numbers, code highlighting, code completion, etc). A Python console will also be available for interacting with your script, and loading additional modules to add functionality to CQCad. This documentation will be filled out over time with as the scripting functionality of CQCad is brought to a more complete state. In the meantime, you can let us know what functionality is most important to you by opening an [issue](https://github.com/jmwright/cqcad/issues) or starting a thread on the [CadQuery Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cadquery).
