## Getting Started

There are three standard items in the scripted CAD workflow:
* Python Editor
* Python Console
* 3D View

The Python editor is where you write your scripts, and includes things like syntax highlighting linting, and code completion. The Python console holds the output from scripts, showing errors and standard output, while also giving users a way to interact with the Python environment and even the CQCad application itself. The 3D view is where the output model of a script is displayed, and allows users to rotate, zoom and pan a model.
