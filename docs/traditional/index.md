## Using CQCad as a Traditional 3D CAD Application

Unfortunately, traditional CAD users are going to hear "we don't support that yet" a lot at the beginning of this project. Multiple extensions are planned for this application that will extend the traditional CAD capabilities of CQCad. Some of those extensions are Sketching, Parts, and Assemblies. This documentation will be filled out over time as more traditional functionality is added to CQCad. You can let us know what functionality is most important to you by opening an [issue](https://github.com/jmwright/cqcad/issues) or starting a thread on the [CadQuery Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cadquery).
