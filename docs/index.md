## CQCad 3D CAD Application

CQCad is designed so that everyone from hobbyists to coders, engineers and scientists can effectively create parametric 3D models. Whether the model is being writen directly in code, or created by the traditional point-and-click method, CQCad stores all models in the CadQuery scripting API format. Users can switch back and forth between using the mouse and writing the model as a script. This allows users to leverage the strengths of each method. For instance, the CadQuery API is cumbersome when creating 2D geometry. With CQCad, the 2D geometry can be created using the mouse, and then the user can switch to the script window to finish the model.

***NOTE:*** CQCad is in the pre-release alpha stage right now. It is not production ready.
