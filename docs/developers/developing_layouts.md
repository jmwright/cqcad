## Developing Layouts
Layouts are dynamically loaded from the [cqcad/cqcad/layouts](https://github.com/jmwright/cqcad/tree/master/cqcad/layouts) directory. The ScriptingTriple extension in that directory gives an example of how layouts are created. More complete documentation will be added here over time, but for now, please use the ScriptingTriple layout as a reference.
