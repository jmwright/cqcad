## Developer Documentation
Developers wanting to help on the core CQCad application should look at the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) documentation. That doc shows how to get a source copy of the application running on your local system. Extensions and Layouts can be developed without having a local source copy of the application. If this is your goal, start with the [Developing Extensions](developing_extensions.md) and [Developing Layouts](developing_layouts.md) sections. Extensions and Layouts can be placed manually in the proper directories and developed in place.
