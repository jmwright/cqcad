## Developing Extensions

Extensions are dynamically loaded from the [cqcad/cqcad/extensions](https://github.com/jmwright/cqcad/tree/master/cqcad/extensions) directory. The Scripting extension in that directory gives an example of how extensions are created. More complete documentation will be added here over time, but for now, please use the Scripting extension as a reference.
