# CQCad
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmwright/cqcad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmwright/cqcad)

***NOTE*** This software is currently not being maintained. The focus has shifted to the Electron-based CadQuery GUI [here](https://github.com/jmwright/cadquery-gui). This repository is left here for reference. 

## Introduction
This software is in a pre-release alpha phase. Do not try to use it unless you have an interest in influencing CadQuery GUI development and are willing to start with an application that is not production-ready. If you are a developer who is interested in contributing to this project, please see the ***Getting Involved*** section below.

A 3D CAD application that combines the power of model scripting with the ease of use of a point-and-click GUI. It uses the CadQuery CAD scripting API as the base file format. The goal is to allow users to choose between a traditional point and click GUI, a CAD scripting GUI, or a hybrid of both.

## Documentation
Complete documentation is being created on this project's [GitHub page](https://jmwright.github.io/cqcad/). There is a table that that is designed to help users choose which path they want to follow to get started with CQCad.
