# CQCad

***NOTE*** - This software is in a pre-release alpha phase. Do not try to use it unless you have an interest in influencing CadQuery GUI development and are willing to start with an application that is not production-ready.

## Introduction
A 3D CAD application that combines the power of model scripting with the ease of use of a point-and-click GUI. It uses the CadQuery CAD scripting API as the base file format. The goal is to allow users to choose between a traditional point and click GUI, a CAD scripting GUI, or a hybrid of both.

## Documentation
