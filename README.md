# CQCad
A 2D/3D CAD application that uses the CadQuery scripting API as the base file format. The goal is to allow users to choose between a traditional point and click GUI, a CAD scripting GUI, or a hybrid of both.

***NOTE*** - This software is in pre-release alpha and may end up being more of a proof-of-concept than a final product. Do not try to use it unless you have an interest in influencing CadQuery GUI development and are willing to start with an application which is just a skeleton for laying out functionality.
