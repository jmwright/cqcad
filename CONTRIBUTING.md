When filing an bug report [issue](https://github.com/jmwright/cqcad/issues), make sure to answer these questions:

1. What version of the software are you running?
2. What operating system are you running the software on?
3. What are the steps to reproduce the bug?

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that does not exist in CQCad, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open a [issue](https://github.com/jmwright/cqcad/issues) which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
